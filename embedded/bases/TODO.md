- **`tag-breakout-base-l432-v1/src/ll_swd_spi.c` is not built.** The target
  compiles `ll_swd.c`. A note in that directory recorded that `ll_swd_spi.c`
  did not work properly on macOS with ChibiOS 21.11. Fix it or remove it, and
  remove `src/ll_swd_spi.c-back` beside it.
- **Unused local sources.** `tag-breakout-base-l432-u375-1v8/src/ll_swd.c` and
  `tag-base-c071/src/stlink-local.c` and `src/ll_swd.c` are not in their
  targets' `project.mk`.
- **Hybrid SPI SWD for a faster F042 base.** The F042 bases still bitbang
  everything. In the optimized `tag-breakout-base-l432-v1/src/ll_swd.c`, every
  shift-out width is a multiple of 8 bits (8, 16, 24, 32) and the odd widths
  are all shift-in (5, 9, 24), so SPI can carry every shift-out phase. That is
  the split `tag-base-c071` and `tag-breakout-base-l432-u375-1v8` already use.
  It was considered for a future base rather than a retrofit.
- **Hot SWD helpers in RAM.** On a future base with a faster MCU and SRAM
  headroom, consider placing only the hottest bitbang helpers in RAM. The F042
  base is not a candidate: its build uses essentially all of its SRAM.
